#### Demo Video: Coming soon

Using this tool, you will be able to work on any small device (such as mobiles) and create a responsive web pages easily. Where you can test them using customizable sliders, writing your own width, or choosing a device from the given ones.

When it comes to use, it's just a piece of cake for nearly anyone. It's easy to understand and useful for the people who can't work on big devices such huge monitors or even bigger. With some devices available and the custom options, you can test nearly all screens on your web page.

It was mainly made for personal use in 2019. Then I developed it to be SiZillion once 2021 started. Later that year, I showed it to one of the professors I knew. I told him that I want to make as an open-source project at github, but he frustrated me with one sentence. He said, "Even it's free, no one will look at it or use it".

That thing made me working on this project harder. In 2022, I subscribed to CS50 from Harvard University and I uploaded it as my final project. Hope you find it useful.

## Installation
This project used CSS and Javascript, so just clone the project to your hard disk, and that is it, or just [go online](mrkebsi.github.io/sizillion/src/).
> Note: You may use a localhost for the univeral linking - `href` or `src` elements that start with `/` to locate something from the root like the navigation of the docs. 

## Contributions
I would really appreciate any contribution on this project. Making SiZillion better means a lot to many others out there. However, I wish you read the [Contribution Conditions](some lik) before anything since this would help you, me, and all of the others.

I know that this part is the worst part of any app. Legal and law speach is hard and boring, but I tried to make it as simple as possible. Check the [Terms of Use from here](some link) to know how to use this app or what are

I want to thank every active developer at StackOverflow since they were a real back points where once I have run into a bug, I found the answer there. Also thanks to Dr.David J. Malan and Barin Yu for their amazing course and all Harvard's stuff.
