			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Terms of Use is telling you to use the app in 
				specific conditions, and if you did any illegal 
				thing, I won't be responsible of any bad 
				results or lawful issues. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: By using the app, you are agree to 
				follow these rule. If you have any problem 
				with some points, please stop using the 
				app and <a href="#seven" style="color: var(--lp2)">contact us</a> 
				to let me help you.
			</p>
			<span id="two"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>Why I Have Such Terms?</h2>
			<p>
				Those terms should be followed not to have some 
				illegal activities with the open source projects. 
				Our terms may be special, so please read it all 
				if you are going to use the app. Otherwise, <i>you 
				will be the responsible of any illegal thing you did.</i>
			</p>
			<span id="three"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>We Are Trying to Make It Simple as Possible</h2>
			<p>
				With all of my efforts to make these terms simple, 
				we were forced to write all these terms. I hope 
				you understand my care for both (we and you). Please 
				keep on reading.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: All these terms are connected to your way 
				of using my application. Copyrights are so simple. 
				You can check them at the bottom of this page.
			</p>
			<span id="four"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h1 align="center">The Most Important Terms</h1>
			<p>
				By now, I will describe for you what you are able
				to do, and what you can't do. The ideas here are 
				well described as I hope. If you have any problem 
				with any of these ones, feel free to contact me using
				the information below in the 
				<a href="#seven">contact details section.</a>
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>You are able to do the following...</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Report a Problem:</b> You can report a 
					problem any time, but only if you checked your 
					web-page first. Never complain while your device
					or website have the problem.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Sent an Idea:</b> If you have a great 
					idea that can upgrade the application, you are
					freely able to send an e-mail describing your idea. 
					If you can make it yourself, try to contribute at 
					<a href="https://github.com/mrkebsi/sizillion/">the 
					project repo,</a> but check the 
					<a href="../Contribution/index.html"> Contribution
					Conditions</a> first.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Ask a Question:</b> You can ask me any question 
					in case it is related to SiZillione, web development, or 
					any thing connected to 
					<a href="https://github.com/mrkebsi">MKebsi's interests.</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Search About or Add an Information:</b> you can 
					ask about a specific information about SiZillion or
					<a href="https://github.com/mrkebsi">MKebsi's 
					interests</a>alone. Moreover, you can send any extra 
					information you have to help me keep on 
					developing my apps.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Contribute:</b> If you are a developer, I will be
					so glad having your contribution. But please read the 
					<a href="../Contribution/"> Contribution
					Conditions</a> before starting as I don't want to 
					let you write many lines of code and then 
					accept only the half!
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Post Issues at Github:</b> If you have a trouble 
					with the site, you can post your issue at Github, but 
					before posting it, check your website since it could
					have the problem. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Share the Open Source Projects:</b> You are fully 
					allowed to share the application with your friends at
					Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and all other social 
					media platforms. Mostly try to share the Github link
					and not the download file because I may change 
					some terms, copyrights, contribution conditions, or 
					other things.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>You are not allowed to do the following...</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Say I Toke Your Files:</b> You can't say that 
					we toke some of your personal information since my 
					project is called "Static Website" which means that
					you are protected for Github. You can check 
					"Github's Privacy Policy" to be sure about you 
					personal files.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Say I Changed Your Website:</b> Also this 
					point is so important. I only made this app to let 
					you test your site, not to change it. So, if any thing 
					have been changed in you website, please make sure 
					about the other  tools (including web builders like
					wordpress, speed testing tools, and other auto 
					testing tools).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Say I Are Monitoring You:</b> All these things
					are not acceptable to be used while uploading the 
					website to Github. So, if there is something you want
					to check more, visit my Privacy Policy page to see 
					your rights.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Upload Viruses:</b> Testing cracked or stolen 
					templates can drive bugs and viruses to the app. 
					Never post or mail anything if you haven't make sure 
					about the project.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Testing Others Projects:</b> If you didn't own the
					project, you are not allowed to send any reports or
					post any issues because you didn't make the website
					yourself. You are allowed to test other websites, but 
					you can't report a problem.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Are You Afraid of Your Personal Information?</h2>
			<p>
				We can tell you are fully protected from SiZillion and
				also from Github. Being offline or online doesn't 
				mean I are tracking you or having your projects 
				with us. If you are not completely satisfied, you can 
				read more in the Privacy Policy page.
