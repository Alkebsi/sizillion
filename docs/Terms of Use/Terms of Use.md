## Why I Have Such Terms?
Those terms should be followed not to have some illegal activities with the open source projects. my terms may be special, so please read it all if you are going to use the app. Otherwise, _you will be the responsible of any illegal thing you did._

## I Are Trying to Make It Simple as Possible
With all of my efforts to make these terms simple, I were forced to write all these terms. I hope you understand my care for both (we and you). Please keep on reading.

>NOTE: All these terms are connected to your way of using my application. Copyrights are so simple. You can check them at the bottom of this page.

# The Most Important Terms
By now, I will describe for you what you are able to do, and what you can't do. The ideas here are well described as I hope. If you have any problem with any of these ones, feel free to contact me using the information below in the contact details section.

### You are able to do the following...
- Report a Problem: You can report a problem any time, but only if you checked your web-page first. Never complain while your device or website have the problem.
- Sent an Idea: If you have a great idea that can upgrade the application, you are freely able to send an e-mail describing your idea. If you can make it yourself, try to contribute at the [project repo](https://github.com/mrkebsi/sizillion/), but check the [Contribution Conditions](somelink) first.
- Ask a Question: You can ask me any question in case it is related to SiZillione, web development, or any thing connected to [MKebsi's interests](https://github.com/mrkebsi).
- Search About or Add an Information: you can ask about a specific information about SiZillion. Moreover, you can send any extra information you have to help me keep on developing my apps.
- Contribute: If you are a developer, I will be so glad having your contribution. But please read the [Contribution Conditions](somelink) before starting as I don't want to let you write many lines of code and then accept only the half!
- Post Issues at [Github](https://www.github.com): If you have a trouble with the site, you can post your issue at Github, but before posting it, check your website since it could have the problem. 
- Share the Open Source Projects: You are fully allowed to share the application with anyone anywhere.

After reading the activities you are able to do, please continue for a little bit to know what is not allowed for you to use. Good time reading for the rest.

### You are not allowed to do the following...
- Say I Toke Your Files: You can't say that I toke some of your personal information since my project is called "Static Website" which means that you are protected for Github. You can check "Github's Privacy Policy" to be sure about you personal files.
- Say I Changed Your Website: Also this point is so important. I only made this app to let you test your site, not to change it. So, if any thing have been changed in you website, please make sure about the other  tools (including web builders like wordpress, speed testing tools, and other auto testing tools).
- Say I Are Monitoring You: All these things are not acceptable to be used while uploading the website to Github. So, if there is something you want to check more, visit my Privacy Policy page to see your rights.
- Upload Viruses: Testing cracked or stolen templates can drive bugs and viruses to the app. Never post or mail anything if you haven't make sure about the project.
- Testing Others Projects: If you didn't own the project, you are not allowed to send any reports or post any issues because you didn't make the website yourself. You are allowed to test other websites, but you can't report a problem.
>NOTE: Doing any of the prohibited things are your own responsible, and I are out of any illegal use.
