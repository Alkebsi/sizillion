			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				This page is an important one for the developers who 
				want to share (contribute) their knowledge and 
				experience with my project. I really respect and
				appreciate your support and efforts helping SiZillion, but 
				we have few points for you to let you understand 
				well how I want my app to be. I wish to see you 
				later contributing with me and all of the other great 
				guys, but I also need you to read those conditions 
				before anything.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: <i>Don't do any contribution without sending 
				your idea to the contact details below. Send an 
				e-mail with the title (Subject) "<b>Contributor</b>" to let 
				us focus on your message.</i>
			</p>

			<h2>Your Rights as a Developer</h2>
			<p>
				First, I obviously respect your experience and your
				efforts, but you should see in what you can help SiZillion in.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>You Are Fully Able to Contribute If...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You want to write or fix a documentations: since I
					may have problems writing them. Even I checked
					them, I may have things needs changing, fixing or
					adding.
				</li>
				<li>
					Helping in the project's interactivity: with the UX, I
					also may have troubles. So, of this is your point, you
					can do it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adding or fixing the device in the "Devices Panel":
					we didn't add that much devices because of the 
					time, but you have to opportunity to add them. Check
					their information, know their viewport, and tell me 
					what you want to add, and I will reply as soon as 
					possible.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adding or fixing the information in the "Advanced
					Information Panel": this section also could be yours.
					We give my experiences to help the developers, but 
					you may have a new vision of what should be done 
					there. You can contribute in this section, and I will 
					try to support your ideas.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adding new features or panels: this part could be
					amazing for the ones who know well how SiZillion 
					should look like. You can add any new feature or 
					panel that can help users test their web-pages much 
					better.
				</li>
				<li>
					Adding additional themes: such as creating a light
					style, customizable style, or other designs available
					in your mind.
				</li>
				<li>
					Build things related to the app: you may have a new, 
					unique idea to change the way this app works. So, 
					you are allowed to do it in case it will help testing the
					screen, browse, responsive web development, or 
					anything related to them
				</li>
			</ul>
			<span id="four"></span>
			<p class="note">
				Again: <i>Don't do any contribution without 
				sending your idea to the contact details below. 
				Send an e-mail with the title (Subject)
				"<b>Contributor</b>" to let me focus on 
				your message.</i>
			</p><br/>
			
			<h3>Never Contribute If you will...</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Change the developer's information: since I 
					create it and did everything in it, you are not 
					allowed at all to change the content details, 
					developer name, or anything sensitive. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Change Terms: you are, at all, prohibited to change 
					any term. If you have a problem with any point, just 
					send an email describing your trouble. <b>Copyrights,
					Contribution Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Terms 
					of Use</b> are a red line to change. Any changes their 
					may cause you a lack of issues and many things 
					which you're not in need for them.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: Please be aware of what are you doing not to 
				hurt yourself, me, or the others, too. I hope you make 
				sure before doing any step, and I are really waiting 
				for a "Contributor" email from you.
			</p>
			<span id="five"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				By reading this part, I hope you are able now to
				contribute and share your experience and knowledge 
				to the world. I are trying to make everything 
				simple, but the laws stay laws, so please follow 
				them. If you have any trouble with one of the points
				above, contact me and I will try to solve it together. 
				We really appreciate your support, time, and attention. 
				See you soon developer.
