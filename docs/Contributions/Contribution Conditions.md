## Your Rights as a Developer
First, I obviously respect your experience and your efforts, but you should see what you can help in.

### You Are Fully Able to Contribute If...
- You want to write or fix the documentations: since I may have problems writing them. Even I checked them, I may have things in need for changing, fixing or adding.
- Helping in the project's interactivity: with the UX, I also may have troubles. So, If this is your point, you can do it.
- Adding or fixing the device in the "Devices Panel": I didn't add that much devices because of the time, but you have the opportunity to add them. Check their information, know their viewport, and tell me what you want to add, and I will reply as soon as possible.
- Adding or fixing the information in the "Advanced Information Panel": this section also could be yours. I give my experiences to help the developers, but you may have a new vision of what should be done there. You can contribute in this section, and I will try to support your ideas.
- Adding new features or panels: this part could be amazing for the ones who know well how SiZillion should look like. You can add any new feature or panel that can help users test their web-pages much better.
- Adding additional themes: such as creating a light style, customizable style, or other designs available in your mind.
- Build things related to the app: you may have a new, unique idea to change the way this app works. So, you are allowed to do it in case it will help testing the screen, browse, responsive web development, or anything related to them

If you have a problem with any point, just send an email describing your trouble. **Copyrights, Contribution Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Use** are a red line to change. Any changes their may cause you a lack of issues and many things which you're not in need for them. If you are a legal adviser, I will hear from your point. However, suggestions are accepted. 

## Conclusion
