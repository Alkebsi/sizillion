			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				In this article, you will learn nearly every thing you need
				to know about SiZillion. It will start explaining some of
				the app fundamentals. Then it will go a little deeper with
				the main panels, text inputs, and buttons. After that, it
				will describe the advanced or extra things in the site.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="note">
				Note: the images were taken from an older version.
				Anyhow, all the texts remain the same;
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				This single page would be enough to teach everything 
				in SiZillion. After reading this article, you will understand
				how it works and what should it does for you. You may
				encounter some troubles around the app, so feel free
				to tell me about it. If you are a developer, you can contribute
				on the project at github, but read the 
				<a href="Contribution & Open-source License/index.html">
				Contribution Conditions</a> from here.
			</p>
			<span id="two"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>How It Works?</h2>
			<p>
				SiZillion is a full static website that works with only
				HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It means that nothing
				will be uploaded to the server. Some developers
				use Node.js (A language that uses Javascript to
				upload information to the server), but this one
				doesn't. This also means that you can download it
				from github and never bring another thing (such 
				as website servers known as "Localhost" or installing
				python). It will directly work with from the browser.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				SiZillion works on taking your web-page temporarily 
				to test it in the top panel. It accepts offline, but this
				doesn't mean I will upload you files. Everything
				will be save with you. In addition, you can check
				the <a href="../Privacy Policy/index.html">Privacy
				Policy</a> page for more information about your 
				personal privacy, and how I protect you.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				This app works on your file using something called
				"iframe" which holds your page. Then you can use
				the sliders or the text inputs to control the width
				(wideness) of the iframe to be like the screens
				available in the world. Not only the width of the 
				screens, but also the height (tallness) of the screen.
				This means that you will be able to test your web-page 
				and make it fully responsive.
			</p>

			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>From Where to Start? Step-By-Step</h2>
			<p>
				The step-by-step guide will go through the app from
				the first time you open it until the moment you test your
				page professionally. You will find everything provided 
				well at this page, so go with it step by step until the end,
				and you you feel comfortable using SiZillion.

			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h3>Step 1: Adding the Page URL</h3>
			<img src="../img/TutImg1.jpg" width="100%" id="fig1"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 1</p><br/>
			
			<p>
				By looking at <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, 
				you will notice that you have to add a URL.
				The URLs are the ones used to direct the 
				browser to your website. There are many 
				types of URLs and the most common ones
				are mentioned below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					HTTP/HTTPS sites: those are the most 
					common ones that you may use. They 
					are used with "www" sites uploaded at
					a server in the network. It will look something
					like this "https://www.google.com/index.html",
				</li>
				<li>
					File sites: those are also common examples
					with you developers. This kind of websites are
					the ones saved in your storage. Mostly they
					are static websites and made with HTML, CSS,
					and Javascript. It will look something like this 
					"C:\User\Desktop\index.html" or
					"file:///sdcard/TheLocation/index.html"
					for mobiles,
				</li>
				<li>
					Localhost sites: this kind is somehow used by
					less common people. This one is made by 
					something called offline hosts or self servers. 
					It allows back-end developers to test their sites 
					offline. It usually uses files like php and asp to 
					make the static sites become dynamic ones. 
					It mostly looks something like this 
					"localhost:8080/index.php", and
				</li>
				<li>
					IP sites: this one is mostly not common and you
					may never need. They are the ones provided by 
					a server (online or offline) and didn't give an 
					explanation to the browser. It works will, but the
					only problem that it doesn't have a readable URL. 
					It should look like this 
					"192.168.14.7:8080/index.html" or 
					"174.250.140.1:3333/index.asp".
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: take care of making mistakes with
				writing the URL like forgiving adding the
				colon ":" after http or never adding the dots
				before the com or after the www.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				All types of url mentioned are allowed to
				be used, but the file extension wasn't really
				clarified, so some are allowed, but the others aren't.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Allowed once are...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML,</li>
				<li>SVG, JPG, PNG etc will appear with a white background as default color,</li>
				<li>PHP, but only with the host(offline or online), and</li>
				<li>AMP web pages.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And some are not allowed such as...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>JS file alone,</li>
				<li>CSS file alone, or</li>
				<li>Any other file that only appear white in the main container.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you need to enter a URL, just go to the browser's
				top bar and copy what is in there and paste it in 
				SiZillion. All should work well. If you got any trouble,
				you can report it to 
				<a href="mailto:dev.mkebsi@gmail.com">MKebsi</a>. 
				After entering it, click on the Done button to see your 
				page on the main container. 
			</p><br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: All the opened panels have this small x.<br/><br/>
				<img src="../img/TutImg1.1.jpg" width="100%" id="fig1.1"/><br/><br/>
				it allows you to close the window without choosing
				any of the options.
			</p>
			<span id="five"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h3>Step 2: The Viewer</h3>
			<img src="../img/TutImg2.jpg" width="100%" id="fig2"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 2</p><br/>
			
			<p>
				After clicking on the Done button, you will see 
				your page in the main container as shown in 
				<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. There, you will 
				have your web-page inside the violet box 
				(<a href="#fig2">Number 1</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				From there, you will be able to change its width 
				and height as will be described below. There are
				two containers to hold your page.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Main Container: is the small, violet box
					(<a href="#fig2">Number 1</a>). 
					It holds the page and resize it will effect 
					the page directly. This one is typically made 
					to let you control your web-page without 
					having changes on your view (such as having 
					a bigger view than your device that can bother
					you zooming the view) or having a User 
					Interface (UI) deformations. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The Secondary Container: is the big, blue box
					(<a href="#fig2">Number 2</a>). 
					This one allows you to scroll horizontally or 
					vertically, but it doesn't allow you to zoom in or 
					out. You can resize this container separately, but
					it would not effect your page. Instead your view 
					(browser viewport) will get wider and narrower.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Below the web-page container, there is a small 
				box called "Page View Type" (<a 
				href="#fig2">Number 3</a>) which tells you what 
				is the kind of device your web-page is tested on
				(whether it's a smart watch, phone, tablet, laptop,
				or PC monitor). This one helps you determine the
				device your website needs, and how to make it 
				better.
			</p>
			<span id="six"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h3>Step 3: Start Resizing and Testing Your Web-page</h3>
			<img src="../img/TutImg3.jpg" width="100%" id="fig3"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 3</p><br/>
			<p>
				Looking at <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, you
				will know that they are two input fields (<a
				href="#fig3">Number 5</a>). They will control 
				your page's width (wideness) and height 
				(tallness). The Secondary Container won't be 
				effected with the values add to these inputs. 
				The text next to them (<a href="#fig3">Number 
				6</a>) tells you which one is the width, and which
				is the height.
			</p>
			<p>
				The text on the top (<a href="#fig3">Number 4</a>)
				is the one that tells you which of the containers you 
				are resizing. Clicking on it won't do anything as it is 
				only a header (title).
			</p>
			<br/>
			<img src="../img/TutImg4.jpg" width="100%" id="fig4"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 4</p><br/>
			<p>
				The other ones <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> 
				are nearly the same, but their main purpose is
				to resize The Secondary Container 
				(<a href="#fig2">Number 2</a>). Each one can 
				be used separately, They are, as mentioned before,
				made for giving the developers the full accessibility
				to test their web-pages professionally.
			</p><br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: For experts, if you set the width of The
				Secondary Container the same as the one for The
				Main Container, you will notice the difference in
				the size. The Secondary Container is set to be
				bigger than The Main Container by 8px all around
				since I add 3px padding and 1px border, there 
				still only 4px.
			</p><br/>
			<img src="../img/TutImg5.jpg" width="100%" id="fig5"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 5</p><br/>
			<p>
				Sliders (<a href="#fig5">Number 11-12</a>) are so
				important to test your web-page faster than using 
				specific numbers. It will help you test your web-page
				so fast from small watches to huge monitors. 
			</p><br/>
			<p class="note">
				NOTE: As telling a developer, I didn't
				mention Smart TVs because they will 
				be equal to monitors. They are the biggest 
				screens that can run a browser. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#fig5">Number 10</a>: is only a title 
					<a href="#fig3">as mentioned above</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#fig5">Number 11</a>: changes the 
					width of your web-page.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#fig5">Number 12</a>: changes the 
					height of your web-page.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<span id="seven"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h3>Step 4: What Are the Buttons Below?</h3>
			<img src="../img/TutImg6.jpg" width="100%" id="fig6"/>
			<p class="figsTxt">Figure 6</p><br/>
			<p>
				<a href="#fig6">These buttons</a> are the ones that
				open the panels which allows you to change the site
				you are testing (<a href="#fig6"> Number 13</a>), choose
				a suitable device (<a href="#fig6">Number 14</a>),
				check your screen's and browser's information (<a href="#fig6">
				Number 15</a>), convert the sizes (cm, in, or px) 
				(<a href="#fig6">Number 16</a>), and visit the site 
				you are testing (<a href="#fig6">Number 17</a>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Every one of the will open the following...
			</p>
			<ul class="spUL">
				<li>
					<a href="#fig6">Number 13</a>: will 
					open the same panel that appears for 
					the first time. It allows you to change 
					the site you are working on. <a href="#fig1">
					The First Figure</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="../img/TutImg7.jpg" class="liImgs" id="fig7"/>
					<p class="figsTxt liImg">Figure 7</p><br/>
					<a href="#fig6">Number 14</a>: will open a panel.
					In it, a lot of device from small watches to the 
					biggest laptops available. 
				</li><br/>
				<p class="note">
					NOTE: Monitor and Smart TV are complexly different from one
					to another, so search for "The viewport of **Your Device**".
				</p>
				<li>
					<img src="../img/TutImg8.jpg" class="liImgs" id="fig8"/>
					<p class="figsTxt liImg">Figure 8</p><br/>
					<a href="#fig6">Number 15</a>: will show you a 
						panel full of useful information about your screen 
						and browser. They can help you if you understand 
						them. But don't worry, they are not something
						important for most people. 
				</li><br/>
				<p class="note">
					NOTE: it may appear something like this...<br/><br/>
					<img src="../img/TutImg9.jpg" width="100%" id="fig9"/><br/><br/>
					Its OK, you are able to scroll up and down. 
					They appear like this if your screen is a 
					little bit smaller than usual (such as mobiles).
				</p>
				<li>
					<img src="../img/TutImg10.jpg" class="liImgs" id="fig10"/>
					<p class="figsTxt liImg">Figure 10</p><br/>
					<a href="#fig6">Number 16</a>: will allow 
					you to see the physical width and height of 
					an element and change its properties 
					(centimeters or inches) to pixel points. 
					Then you can add the pixels to the site you 
					are working on.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<span id="eight"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				After all this reading, I can tell you that using 
				SiZillion is a piece of cake. I put everything 
				in one single page to make it as simple as possible. 
				So, if you have any idea, report, feedback, question, 
				problem, or information, head directly to 
				<a href="mailto: dev.mkebsi@gmail.com">MKebsi</a> 
				and ask any thing you want there. I hope a good 
				time for you using our app. Thanks for you time 
				and attention.
