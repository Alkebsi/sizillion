			<h2 >What Is SiZillion?</h2>
			<p>
				SiZillion is one of the best testing tools. It allows website
				developers to <i>test their web-pages on multiple devices.</i>
				This tool gives you the full ability to make responsive 
				websites and check it on nearly all the devices.
			</p>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<img src="../img/panel.png" width="100%" alt="the main panels of SiZillion"/>
			<p>
				Using this tool, you will be able to load your
				web-page into the main panel and test it in there.
				you can see the type of device you are working on 
				on the small bar on the left.
			</p>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<img src="../img/mainFrame.png" width="100%" alt="the width and height text inputs"/>
			<p>
				You have <i>custom data inputs where you can add your 
				own width and height</i>&nbsp; to your web-page. You can also
				make sure about the device type (whether it's laptop or another 
				device) in the small box under the page. 
			</p>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<img src="../img/sliders.png" width="100%" alt="the testing sliders for any page at SiZillion"/>
			<p id="two">
				With all the abilities mentioned above, you have
				additional <i>sliders that change the the size, too.</i>
				This will let you make sure about most devices manually. 
			</p>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2 >Who Should Use It?</h2>
			<p>
				It's nearly a tool that <i>all developers need in their
				daily workflow</i>. It's acceptable for experts in this
				industry, and the other ones who already started 
				with responsive website development.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				With dark colors all around the app,
				it is easy to use it in low light room because this
				tool have a dark stable colors that never bother
				the eyes.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				The simplicity is our first goal that is why I
				made this app. It has a <i>simple interface with
				lots of useful inputs and panels</i>. There are some
				other extra things around the app, and I gave
				you all the abilities to do what is best for you.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				About the device requirements, there are no special
				requirements. It only needs a new web browser(with
				no spacial version, just 2020 or higher not to find
				unexpected things in the user interface). This can
				work in nearly all the browsers, and it's better to 
				<i>use Google Chrome or Firefox</i>. 
			</p>
			<span id="three"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2 >Is It Online?</h2>
			<p>
				On most cases, people have network connected 
				anytime anywhere, so <i>we provide it online</i>.
				You can check your web-pages if they are stored in
				your device or uploaded online.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				This can be a great thing for some, but there are
				others who find it difficult to went to Google and
				search every time they want some thing. I were
				able to put this app as an open source website.
				Which means that <i>we provide it offline for the ones
				who need it</i>. You can find the link to its repository 
				down in the copyrights at the bottom.
			</p>
			<span id="four"></span>
			
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<h2 >Who Made It and Why?</h2>
			<p>
				It was first made for a personal use, and it
				developed till it reached another level. Then
				the owner decided to share it with his friends to
				have rates from the them.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				It was a simple one, but after that, he made it
				better and open source, and thats what are you
				seeing now. <i>It still not fully completed app, so if 
				you have anything to say, feel free to contact 
				<a href="mailto:dev.mkebsi@gmail.com">MKebsi (the owner)</a></i>.
				We are waiting for your feedbacks. Don't feel shy at
				all. Send thanks, critical, feedback, or a problem report
				email, and I will try to respond as soon as possible.
